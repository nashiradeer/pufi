# Nashira Deer // Pufi

Pufi is a programming language designed to be concurrent by default to be used in the development of plugins and extensions.

This repository consists of prototypes, ideas and specifications that can be used in the development of implementations of Pufi runtimes and compilers and their derivatives such as Pufi Bytecode and Pufi Assembly.

## Disclaimer

It's not a secret that Pufi bears a certain similarity to Rust, Go and C, and this is not an accident but a design choice that aims to offer the simplicity of C-like syntax while having advanced and modern features, just like Rust and Go do.
