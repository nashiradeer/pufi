# Nashira Deer // Pufi

Pufi is an asynchronous programming language with a simple implementation to be used in any project that allows the users create plugins, extensions or modifications.

This repository consists of prototypes, ideas and specifications that can be used in the development of implementations of Pufi runtimes and compilers and their derivatives such as Pufi Bytecode and Pufi Assembly.

## Disclaimer

It's not a secret that Pufi bears a certain similarity to Rust, Go and C, and this is not an accident but a design choice that aims to offer the simplicity of C-like syntax while having advanced and modern features, just like Rust and Go do.

Pufi Bytecode is versioned because we will release major versions that will not be compatible with current one, this is planned to keep the bytecode simple and your implementation easier, always removing legacy bullshit from it.
